Assuming you have data from some distribution, and you want to predict the value of the *next* observation from that distribution, what is a good estimate? Intuitively, guessing the mean of the sample should result in the least error. What is the expectation of that error?


```{r}
n <- 100
sigma <- 4
mu <- 10

res <- replicate(10000, expr = {
  x <- rnorm(n, mu, sigma)
  x_new <- rnorm(1, mu, sigma)
  se <- (x_new - mean(x))^2
  s <- sd(x)
  est.mse <- s^2 + s^2/n
  c(se, est.mse)
})
# measured mse
mse <- mean(res[1, ])
mse

# true mse
sigma^2 + sigma^2 / n

# mse estimated from data
est.mse <- mean(res[2, ])
est.mse
hist(res[2, ], prob=T)
var(res[2, ])

```
