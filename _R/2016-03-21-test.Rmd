This is an R Markdown document. I'll be testing [David Robinson's](http://varianceexplained.org/about/) [script](https://github.com/dgrtwo/dgrtwo.github.com/blob/master/_scripts/knitpages.R) with my implementation of a Jekyll Blog. Specifically, I'm using Github Pages to host my site and I'd like to try embedding RMardown documents. In the future, I'd like to implement something similar for IPython Notebook files.

## R Code and Output

```{r, include=F}
library(googleVis)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## R Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

## ggplot

```{r}
hist.ggplot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
hist.ggplot
```

## googleVis

An interactive plot. I tried a few different interactive plotting tools as outlined [here](http://ouzor.github.io/blog/2014/11/21/interactive-visualizations.html) but had a lot of trouble. 

```{r, results='asis'}
gvis.options <- list(hAxis="{title:'mpg'}",
                     width=800, height=600)
hist.gvis <- gvisHistogram(data=mtcars["mpg"], options=gvis.options)
print(hist.gvis, tag="chart")
```

For googleVis you'll want to "print" the plot and set the chunk option *results* to "asis". The source R Markdown file can be found [here](https://github.com/dkmehrmann/dkmehrmann.github.io/blob/master/_R/2016-03-21-test.Rmd).

## Conclusion

It appears as though rendering R Markdown documents in Jekyll is possible and not too difficult. In the future I'd like to try out rendering IPython notebooks, and if that is indeed possible I think it shows that Jekyll and GitHub Pages are a fantastic platform for Data Science blogging.
